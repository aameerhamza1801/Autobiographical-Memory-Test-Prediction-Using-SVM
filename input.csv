It will likely be a survey and I will have to be as truthful as always while filling it out. I answer them honestly but sometimes the choices are close and picking one can be difficult.,1.00,I am self-employed and I am involved in several areas work-wise. Sometimes the work inflow is fairly predictable but other times it is not. So it is likely that the work inflow in the next day or so is not very predictable and that creates a fair amount of pressure because I believe in doing a good job of everything I do. I am usually quite efficient but I often worry about whether I could be as efficient as I could be.,1.00,"I hope to reach an agreement with my parents about not renting out a property we own. They want to rent it out and I am convinced we should not because tenants could cause problems. Besides, my parents are elderly and geographically our family is spread out globally.

It is often easy to forget  the danger it poses as we go about our daily lives but I do sometimes ponder - ""what if something were to happen over the next day or so?"" This especially hit home because the bus terminal from where I frequently catch buses to go various places was recently shut down because of terrorist activity. It reopened soon but it is difficult to keep the danger that things may not go that well the next time out of one's mind and the danger could easily present itself over the next day or so.",1.00,I cherish the freedoms we have but I must say it seems like it is constantly being threatened. So it has practically become a daily occurrence for me to watch out for ways in which our freedoms could be taken away from us and be as politically involved as possible to stop it. I follow the news regularly and experience the exhilirations of freedoms and the frustration of seeing people undermine it pretty much constantly these days.,4.00,"We are now smack into winter and I wonder if the temperatures are going to be intolerably low over the next day or so, more so than the forecasters say.

I will definitely think of ways to improve this situation over the next day.",1.00,I am adding to the lines of business that I am involved in. I came up with a new strategy for trading financial products and I am going to continue with that over the next day or so. Doing well in that is critical to my long-term success.

I am travelling right now ( and I am using public transportation) and I will likely observe many faces over the next day or so.

I expect I will be putting these ""talents"" to good use over the next day as I travel.",3.00,My doctor recently prescribed a new dosage for the eye drops that I need to apply.

I ended up quitting and working for myself but I am glad there was the lack of agreement. Even though things have been challenging, it has been more than worthwhile.",2.00,"I have had considerable pain in my foot due to a medical condition that I have. I haven't been exercising as much as I should have been. I have tried to maintain my health as well as possible (including trying yoga) and this may have alleviated the pain some. Overall, I am glad that I have kept the pain in check and hope to do the things needed to improve going forward.",2.00,I have always shown a lot of respect to my parents but in the recent past their respect for me seems to be declining. I took my father on a vacation in Europe recently and I must say I organize these things well. But there were little things that happened that seemed to suggest that his respect for me was not what it once was.,3.00,"I was mugged about 2 years ago and there was no indication of any danger where it happened. It was about 3 pm and 5 hoods suddenly came out of an apartment building near my house, grabbed my backpack and punched me in the face. Fortunately I had kept my phone and wallet well-hidden in my backback. The danger lessened when they discovered that there was not much they could get from me (or so they thought). I got my backpack back and was able to get home and call  the police.",1.00,"I have to say that starting to work for myself instead of others has been the best experience of freedom for me. I have been able to set my work hours, work as hard I want to on what I want to. I love the fields of finance, computer science and mathematics and have been able to work productively on all of these areas since I started working for myself about 10 years ago.",2.00,This will definitely be the simple act of getting a cold beverage after a long journey yesterday. I wanted to travel light and deliberately didn't pack any drinks. But I was able to enjoy the cold beverage more than usual after the journey.,1.00,I went on a trip to Prince Edward Island in Canada this past July. It was my first trip there and I have to say that the trip turned to be a much bigger success than I had thought it might be. Public transportation is not a good option in parts of the region which makes it challenging. I was able to successfully combine public and private transportation to make the most of my trip there.,1.00,"I used to work in an office building near the World Trade Center in New York City.

I give him dead eyes and a grimace but am polite as my job requires me to be.

Not a single one agreed that it would be a good thing to let corporations have more money to give to their workers because if they did. The workers might have to get off welfare and then see that only leeches live on the governmnet and only democrats care about the leeches and need the leeches to stay in power.,4.00,It was great to see the GOP pass this so now the democrats get to go home over the holiday break and see the pain and suffering lifted off the people and then be forced to answer why they didn't support this legislation.,4.00,The future will only show worse how much respect or lack there of democrats have of the economic system and how they feel money should flow through them and they are risking losing that argument by not respecting the people that voted for them,4.00,Democrats are in real danger of losing their party over this.

I don't feel like anyone respects me and if I made money I think my husband and family would treat me with more respect. I think the fact that I can take care of myself will make my husband take notice that I don't need him as much and he will treat me better.,2.00,Eventually my son will have to drive in bad weather.

I hope he can remain calm and not worry so much about the danger.,4.00,I will be glad when my home finally sells. I own my home with my Mom and I feel tied to it because of her.

I love seeing her, but it is hard financially to make it up to see her as often as she likes. I went and saw her twice this past summer and she still pressured me to come more often. With the kid's schedule and our financial situation that is just not possible. It is much easier for her to visit us.",3.00,I had a meeting with my daughter's gymnastics coach a few weeks ago and we were in agreement that my daughter should be moved up to the next level.

I am so proud of her hard work.,1.00,"Last summer I was going outside to feed our animals, when I stepped off the back porch and twisted my ankle badly and landed on my knee. I was in a lot of pain and I was at home by myself. I wasn't sure what I was going to do. I knew I could get any help. I managed to pull my self up on my porch and sat there for a long time.

I knew I was in no shape to drive, so he drove to pick her up and took me to the emergency room.",1.00,This year our gymnastic's gym started a home school program. A lot of the Mom's had questions about how to go about home schooling their children for the first time. I have been home schooling for 22 years and they knew that my kids were very smart. The respected my opinion and had a lot of questions about how to progress. It felt nice to know that they respected what I had to say.,1.00,"A couple of months ago I heard sirens going off outside. I didn't think much about it because we live off a main road. We have ambulances and police taking the road on the way to accidents quite often. I was getting ready to leave the house, but decided to wait a little bit in case there had been an accident. I turned on the television and saw where an active shooter was in my neighborhood.

I am scared to think of how dangerous it was to be out during that time.",1.00,"I remember after high school getting my first apartment by myself. It was nothing special and was filled with second hand furniture, but it was all mine. I felt such freedom to have the ability to do what I want without having to answer to anyone. I could decorate how I wanted. I could come and go without having to tell anyone. It was nice to be able to make my own decision and I felt great freedom in my new life.",2.00,Two weeks ago it snowed in South Texas. We very rarely get snow.

I have home schooled him his whole education and have had a lot of people doubt my ability to do so. I was so happy to see him not only graduate, but graduate with high test scores. I questioned my ability so many times throughout the years while schooling him and it was good to see him educated, successful and happy.",1.00,"We had a neighbor that lived down the street from us a couple of years ago that was evil. He was always stirring up trouble. He was racist and would do mean things to our neighbors who are Hispanic. He would call the cops on them when nothing was going on just to harass them. He also harassed another neighbor who was a single woman. He was always trying to talk to her and when she ignored him he started calling the cops on her for no reason.

They will tell me what an embarrassment I am in the guise of brutal honesty I'm sure,",1.00,I'll end up being pressured from one of my friends to join them at  restaurant in the middle of a blizzard so they can have someone around while they drink because they have poor impulse control and I lack a backbone when it comes to this person.,1.00,I get the feeling within the year if my father doesn't die from his terminal illness my mother and him will agree it is time to cut me out of their lives and abandon me to my fate. Figures can't trust anyone.,2.00,My grandfather who I was closest to more than anyone else in the world turned on me two years or so ago after my failure to make any meaningful progress in my career or life. He effectively disowned me. I tried forgiving him after it taking awhile but as he is almost 100 his memory is not what it was and his last vivid persisting memory is of me not trying so each time I see him it's the same conversation over and over again about what a failure and disappointment I am until he finds out I'm doing better than congratulates me until the next time I see him when he forgets or confuses me with someone else. It causes me much pain but it's my own fault.,3.00,I've lost the ability to care about anything or anyone other than my own progress as I've finally started to take steps to respect myself and thus make myself respectable to other people but I still struggle with seeing myself as someone with any value.,4.00,Sometimes I got out walking quite late in the night into 1 or 2 in the morning even though I'm a relatively big guy who can handle myself in a fight I've become aware a few times of people that I think are planning to break into other people's houses which makes me hurry home to avoid the danger.,1.00,As unfortunate as the things that have happened to me are I remind myself I've never been as free in my life as I am at this moment. At least in theory as I am free to attempt to structure my own time as I see fit.,2.00,Every walk I've undertaken in the past month or so has been in the biting or near biting cold as winter is happening in my area. This was much easier in the summer.,5.00,I keep thinking of when I graduated college back in 2010 and how life seemed good and I could accomplish anything. Then one by one the doors started shutting on me and no one wanted to hire me for anything more than menial work despite my previous solid work history or high marks in college.,5.00,Sometimes at night when I'm finished with my allotted work I keep wondering if I'm being punished for some evil I've done. I replay every act in mind that's been negative or close to negative and mentally force myself to relive the event.,3.00,I keep thinking about the door to my room that needs to be repaired and how I've repeatedly put it off. I'll try and get around to it next month.,1.00,I dream of the day when I will no longer have to live in this room I'm currently in it's like a prison and I relish every day I can escape it.,4.00,As I've lost more and more weight I've actually regained some structure and definition to my formerly fat face. I still have a long way to go but I'm happy to see it improve every day. Maybe in the future it will be even better.,4.00,One day I want to go ahead and start wearing contacts for a different eye color.,1.00,I constantly worry my computer is going to give out and just stop working. I can't really afford to fix it and that would be the end of my being able to earn money at the moment. Everyday I wonder if today is going to be that day. Hopefully it lasts long enough for me to save up the money to make the repairs.,1.00,I remember having a painful conversation with a trusted friend when both he and I were going through hard times. He was somewhat verbally abusive in the name of being brutally honest but I think he was just projecting.,1.00,I used to constantly cave into peer pressure from my friends quite often. Not so much anymore though.,3.00,One of my friends and I have been on a weight loss journey together as we were both close to 400 pounds at one point. In the space of over half a year we've both slimmed down to 250ish after making a pact to motivate the other to finish the journey.,2.00,I realize my previous response about my grandfather and his memory should have been written here. My grandfather has been losing his memory and his last active one was of me being a disappointment and disowning me. Even though I turned things around and have improved things he sometimes forgets and I get to hear the same conversation until I pipe in and congratulates me again. It's quite painful. For a future version of this which I should of said earlier I would mention being abandoned by one or both of my parents in the near future either due to my father dying from his chronic illness or from being disowned by them both.,3.00,For a long time until recently I lost all respect for myself the past 2 years has been a journey in respecting myself.,2.00,Similar to the situation with pain I also reversed this with the night walking danger situation. The past couple of nights I've heard of people casing local houses to rob them and I've seen some cars idling at night when I've been out walking and have felt in danger when going by them. For a more future oriented response to fix my earlier answer I would mention feeling a sense of danger for the next project I have coming up: deploying to puerto rico to volunteer and help out for a month or so as the island is still in great distress and somewhat unsafe.,3.00,When I'm able to finally leave the place I am living right now I will regain the freedom I used to have when I had my own place.,5.00,I can't wait for the winter to end as it's been constantly cold the past few days.

This will be difficult but has to be done to move forward withhim.,1.00,I think my relationship might be in danger as far as my friend Ben and I go. He has been lying to me a lot and not being honest with me. I feel he has this nature of being very boastful and tries to do more than he should to look good. It all tends to be really bad for the both of us that he doesn't fall through on his promises.,2.00,Freedome is something I might have yo look more into.

There was a gap in the shield wall, and I leapt through it, only to meet a spear that was being thrust out through the gap. It hit me in the nose, flipping me backwards into a snowbank.

He said that I couldn't impress him by talking, let alone by talking tough; I needed to demonstrate what it meant to be a good person, and let my actions speak for me. I took it to heart and am grateful that he took the time to show me how to be better, instead of just telling me off.",1.00,"I was at a bar with some people I had met earlier in the night, friends of a coworker. We had hit it off at a group dinner and decided to move to another part of town to keep drinking. They seemed to know the only other people in the bar we went to, and I ended up in conversation with a man who turned out to be the owner of the bar. He also turned out to be a major figure in the local organized crime scene, and my newly acquired companions were there to buy cocaine from him.

I knew that my blanket was not enough to keep me warm, but I had been dozing off and on for a few hours when I woke up and knew that something was wrong. I woke my husband up and told him that I was too cold and I needed help. He was grumpy until we got out to his car, where he realized the doors were frozen shut, my hair was frozen solid in places, and I was corpse-blue.

I had not learned to control my emotions, and it seemed at the time like my thoughts and desires were different than everyone else's.
